## [Unreleased]

### Added

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2024-12-09

### Changed - BREAKING 

- **Complete API Restructure**: Renamed crate from `jailed-path` to `strict-path` with comprehensive API updates
- **Core Type Names**: 
  - `Jail<T>` → `PathBoundary<T>` - represents the secure root boundary
  - `VirtualRoot<T>` → `VirtualRoot<T>` - unchanged name but new implementation  
  - `JailedPath<T>` → `StrictPath<T>` - path validated within boundary
  - `VirtualPath<T>` → `VirtualPath<T>` - unchanged name but updated integration
- **Method Naming Consistency**:
  - `jailed_join()` → `strict_join()` - join paths within boundary
  - `systempath_display()` → `strictpath_display()` - display system path
  - Kept `virtualpath_display()` for virtual path display
- **Enhanced Type System**: Complete rewrite of internal validation pipeline using `PathHistory<State>` for compile-time path validation guarantees
- **Extended Platform Support**: Added comprehensive feature gates for `dirs`, `tempdir`, and `app-path` integrations

### Added

- **Convenience Constructors**: 
  - `PathBoundary::try_new_config()`, `try_new_data()`, `try_new_cache()` for system directories
  - `PathBoundary::try_new_temp()` for RAII temporary directories

  - CVE-2025-8088 style ADS traversal attacks (Windows)
  - Zip-slip and tar-slip extraction scenarios
  - Unicode normalization edge cases
  - TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) attack scenarios
  - Platform-specific symlink/junction escape attempts

### Security

- **Windows ADS Protection**: Specific defenses against CVE-2025-8088 style attacks using NTFS Alternate Data Streams
- **Enhanced Symlink Validation**: Improved detection and rejection of symlink-based escape attempts on all platforms  
- **Directory Traversal Hardening**: Comprehensive protection against `../` style attacks through virtual path clamping
- **Path Injection Prevention**: Robust validation of all user-supplied path components before filesystem operations

### Fixed  

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Resolved Windows/Unix path separator handling inconsistencies
- **Memory Safety**: Eliminated potential path buffer overflows through type-safe path construction

## [0.0.4] - 2025-08-03

### Added

- **Virtual root display system**: `JailedPath` now always displays as starting from the jail root using forward slashes (`/`) on all platforms, hiding internal filesystem details from users
- **Internal type-state validation engine**: Introduced `ValidatedPath` with compile-time state tracking for strict, auditable security guarantees through marker types (`Raw`, `Clamped`, `JoinedJail`, `Canonicalized`, `BoundaryChecked`)
- Removed: The `try_jail()` helper has been removed in favor of explicit `Jail::try_new(...).try_path(...)` usage for clarity and consistency.
- **Safe file operations trait**: `JailedFileOps` trait provides jail-safe file operations (`read_to_string()`, `write_bytes()`, `exists()`, `create_dir_all()`, etc.) without exposing raw paths
- **Enhanced examples and documentation**: Added comprehensive examples for real-world usage patterns, marker types, virtual root display, and safe file operations

### Changed

- **Path validation behavior**: All path validation now clamps traversal and absolute paths to the jail root instead of rejecting them - escapes are mathematically impossible
- **API restructure**: Complete refactor of `JailedPath` and `PathValidator` for stricter jail enforcement and cross-platform consistency using type-state validation
- **Enhanced crate description**: Updated to "Prevent directory traversal with type-safe virtual path jails and safe symlinks"
- **Non-existent jail handling**: `PathValidator` now allows creation with non-existent jail directories (validates they would be directories if they exist)
- **Comprehensive test suite**: Updated all integration and unit tests to validate new clamping behavior and type-state API

### Dependencies

- **Added**: `tempfile = "3.20.0"` as dev dependency for robust testing

### Technical Implementation

- **Type-state pipeline**: All path validation uses `ValidatedPath<State>` where `State` tracks the exact sequence of security transformations
- **Clamping algorithm**: Absolute paths are forcibly clamped to jail root; all root components stripped before joining to jail
- **Virtual path abstraction**: Clean separation between user-facing virtual paths and internal real filesystem paths

### Fixed

- All Clippy lints resolved (`needless_borrow`, `redundant_clone`)
- Cross-platform display consistency across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- All doctests and integration tests now pass with new validation behavior
- Documentation examples compile and run successfully

## [0.0.3] - 2025-07-21

### Added
- **Type-State Police™ branding**: Added humorous tagline to embrace the compile-time safety theme
- **Enhanced documentation**: Comprehensive docs for `PathValidator::with_jail()` with clear error conditions

### Changed
- **Crate description**: Updated to "Advanced path validation: symlink-safe, multi-jail, compile-time guaranteed"
- **Better examples**: All examples now use realistic paths ("public", "config", "uploads") instead of temp directories
- **Improved documentation flow**: Reorganized sections for better user experience

### Dependencies
- Updated `soft-canonicalize` to `0.1.2`
- Updated `app-path` dev dependency to `1.0.2`

- **Cross-platform examples**: All examples now work correctly on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Soft canonicalize extraction**: Moved soft canonicalize functionality to separate `soft-canonicalize` crate
  - Added dependency on `soft-canonicalize = "0.1.0"`

  - Enables reuse of soft canonicalize algorithm in other projects

### Security
