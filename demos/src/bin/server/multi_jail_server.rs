//! A more realistic example of a server that uses multiple jails
//! to manage different security contexts:
//!
//! 1.  **Public Assets**: A path boundary for serving static files like CSS, JS, and images.
//!     - Marker Type: `PublicAssets`
//!     - Directory: `public/`
//!
//! 2.  **User Uploads**: A path boundary for handling user-specific file uploads.
//!     - Marker Type: `UserUploads`
//!     - Directory: `user_data/`
//!
//! This example demonstrates how `strict-path`'s marker types prevent accidental
//! cross-contamination of paths at compile time, ensuring, for example, that a
//! user-generated path can't be used to access a public asset, and vice-versa.
