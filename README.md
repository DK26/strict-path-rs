**The moment a path string enters your program from outside your code — an HTTP request, a config file, an archive entry, a database row, an LLM tool call — reach for `strict-path`.** It pins that string to a directory you chose, so it can't escape via symlinks, encoding tricks, or platform quirks. [19+ real-world CVEs covered](https://dk26.github.io/strict-path-rs/security_methodology.html#12-coverage-what-we-protect-against).

> Prepared statements prevent SQL injection. `strict-path` prevents path injection. Same rule: **data from outside never gets to act as structure.**

## 🔍 Why String Checking Isn't Enough

You strip `..` and check for `/`. But attackers have a dozen other vectors:

| Attack vector | String filter | `strict-path` |
|---|---|---|
| `../../../etc/passwd` | ✅ Caught (if done right) | ✅ Blocked |
| Symlink inside boundary → outside | ❌ Passes silently | ✅ Symlink resolved, escape blocked |
| Windows 8.3: `PROGRA~1` bypasses filter | ❌ Passes silently | ✅ Short name resolved, escape blocked |
| NTFS ADS: `file.txt:secret:$DATA` | ❌ Passes silently | ✅ Blocked ([CVE-2025-8088](https://dk26.github.io/strict-path-rs/security_methodology.html)) |
| Unicode tricks: `..∕` (fraction slash U+2215) | ❌ Passes silently | ✅ Blocked |
| Junction/mount point → outside boundary | ❌ Passes silently | ✅ Resolved & blocked |
| TOCTOU race condition (CVE-2022-21658) | ❌ No defense | ⚡ Mitigated at validation |
| Null byte injection | ❌ Truncation varies | ✅ Blocked |
| Mixed separators: `..\../etc` | ❌ Often missed | ✅ Normalized & blocked |

**How it works:** `strict-path` resolves the path on disk — follows symlinks, expands short names, normalizes encoding — then proves the resolved path is inside the boundary. The input string is irrelevant. Only where the path *actually leads* matters.

<details>
<summary><strong>Why canonicalization beats string blocklists</strong></summary>

String-matching libraries maintain lists of dangerous patterns — `..`, `%2e%2e`, `%c0%ae` (overlong UTF-8), `&#46;` (HTML entities), full-width Unicode dots, zero-width characters, and dozens more. Every new encoding trick requires a new blocklist entry, and a single miss is a bypass.

`strict-path` doesn't play that game. It asks the OS to resolve the path, then checks where it landed. URL-encoded `%2e%2e` isn't decoded — it's a literal directory name containing percent signs. Overlong UTF-8 sequences, HTML entities, code-page homoglyphs (¥→`\` in CP932, ₩→`\` in CP949) — none of these matter because the OS never interprets them as path separators or traversal sequences. The canonicalized result either falls inside the boundary or it doesn't.

This is the same principle behind SQL prepared statements: instead of escaping every dangerous character (and inevitably missing one), you separate code from data structurally. `strict-path` separates *path resolution* from *path text*, making the entire class of encoding-bypass attacks irrelevant by design.

## ⚡ Get Secure in 30 Seconds

```toml
[dependencies]
strict-path = "0.2"
```

```rust
use strict_path::StrictPath;

// Untrusted input: user upload, API param, config value, AI agent output, archive entry...
let file = StrictPath::with_boundary("/var/app/downloads")?
    .strict_join(&untrusted_user_input)?; // Every attack vector above → Err(PathEscapesBoundary)

let contents = file.read()?; // Built-in safe I/O — stays within the secure API

// Third-party crate needs AsRef<Path>?
third_party::process(file.interop_path()); // &OsStr (implements AsRef<Path>)
```

If the input resolves outside the boundary — by *any* mechanism — `strict_join` returns `Err`.

## 🎯 When to Use What

**The trigger is the *origin of the path string*.** Is the string something your code produced, or did it come from outside?

- **`Path` / `PathBuf`** (std) — the string is **yours**: a hardcoded constant, or assembled entirely from values your own code produced. There's no external input to validate.
- **`StrictPath`** — the string came from **outside** (HTTP request, config file, archive entry, DB row, env var, LLM tool call, …) and an escape attempt is an **error** you want to know about. Log it, deny the request, abort the operation. Silently substituting a different file would hide the problem.
- **`VirtualPath`** — the string came from **outside**, and an escape attempt should be **clamped**. The caller is navigating a sandbox you gave them (their own "/"), and `..` off the top just lands them back at their root.

**Choose `StrictPath` (≈ 90% of cases):**
- Archive extraction, config loading
- File uploads to shared storage (admin panels, CMS assets, single-tenant apps)
- LLM / AI agent file operations
- Shared system resources (logs, cache, assets)
- *Any case where escaping a path boundary is considered malicious.*

**Choose `VirtualPath` (≈ 10% of cases):**
- Multi-tenant file storage (SaaS per-user directories, isolated views)
- Malware analysis sandboxes
- Container-like plugins
- *Any case where you want freedom of operation under complete isolation.*

<details>
<summary><strong>What <code>strict-path</code> is NOT</strong></summary>

- Not a sandbox or chroot — your process still has whatever filesystem access the OS grants it.
- Not a replacement for filesystem permissions, SELinux/AppArmor, or `openat2(RESOLVE_BENEATH)`. Compose with those where you have them.
- Not a URL or shell-argument sanitizer — different injection class, different tool.
- Not a performance-tuned lexical normalizer — canonicalization touches the disk. If every path is a hardcoded constant and you need nanoseconds, `std::path` is the right tool.

## 🚀 Real-World Examples

### Archive Extraction (Zip Slip Prevention)

Take `PathBoundary` as a function parameter when the boundary is reused — every `strict_join` on it produces a `StrictPath` pinned inside that directory, so the function body doesn't have to re-validate.

```rust
use strict_path::PathBoundary;

// Prevents CVE-2018-1000178 (Zip Slip) automatically (https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability)
fn extract_archive(
    extraction_dir: PathBoundary,
    archive_entries: impl IntoIterator<Item = (String, Vec<u8>)>,
) -> std::io::Result<()> {
    for (entry_path, data) in archive_entries {
        // Malicious paths like "../../../etc/passwd" → Err(PathEscapesBoundary)
        let safe_file = extraction_dir.strict_join(&entry_path)?;
        safe_file.create_parent_dir_all()?;
        safe_file.write(&data)?;
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

> The equivalent of `PathBoundary` for `VirtualPath` is the `VirtualRoot` type.

### Multi-Tenant Isolation

```rust
use strict_path::VirtualRoot;

// No path-traversal or symlinks can escape the tenant root.
// Everything is clamped to the virtual root, including symlink resolutions.
fn handle_file_request(tenant_id: &str, requested_path: &str) -> std::io::Result<Vec<u8>> {
    let tenant_root = VirtualRoot::try_new_create(format!("./tenants/{tenant_id}"))?;

    // "../../other_tenant/secrets.txt" → clamped to "/other_tenant/secrets.txt" in THIS tenant
    let user_file = tenant_root.virtual_join(requested_path)?;
    user_file.read()
}
```

## 🧠 Compile-Time Safety with Markers

`StrictPath<Marker>` enables **domain separation and authorization** at compile time — handing a user-uploaded file to a function that only accepts public assets is a compile error, not a runtime check:

```rust
use strict_path::{PathBoundary, StrictPath};

struct PublicAssets;
struct UserUploads;

fn serve_public_asset(file: &StrictPath<PublicAssets>) { /* safe to stream to any caller */ }

let assets  = PathBoundary::<PublicAssets>::try_new_create("./assets")?;
let uploads = PathBoundary::<UserUploads>::try_new_create("./uploads")?;

let css:    StrictPath<PublicAssets> = assets.strict_join("style.css")?;
let avatar: StrictPath<UserUploads>  = uploads.strict_join("avatar.jpg")?;

serve_public_asset(&css);       // ✅ OK — PublicAssets matches
// serve_public_asset(&avatar); // ❌ Compile error — UserUploads is not PublicAssets
```

## 🧰 What You Get Beyond Path Validation

- 🛡️ **Built-in I/O** — `read()`, `write()`, `create_dir_all()`, `read_dir()` — no need to drop to `std::fs`
- 📐 **Compile-time markers** — `StrictPath<UserUploads>` vs `StrictPath<SystemConfig>` can't be mixed up
- 🔒 **Thread-safe** — all types are `Send + Sync`; share across threads and async tasks
- 🤖 **LLM-ready** — doc comments and [context files](https://github.com/DK26/strict-path-rs/blob/main/LLM_CONTEXT_FULL.md) designed for AI agents with function calling

<summary><strong>Why the API looks the way it does (design notes for security reviewers and LLM integrators)</strong></summary>

<br>

This crate combines Rust's type system with Python's "one obvious way to do it" philosophy to build an API where **LLMs and humans naturally reach for the correct pattern** — wrong code either doesn't compile, or the compiler tells you exactly what to do instead.

- **No `AsRef<Path>`, no `Deref`** — if `StrictPath` implemented these, anything could call `.join()` on it and build a new path that bypasses boundary validation entirely. That one method on `Path` undoes everything `strict_join()` enforces. The type system makes it unreachable.
- **`interop_path()` returns `&OsStr`, not `&Path`** — `Path` has `.join()` and `.parent()`, which let you build new unvalidated paths. `OsStr` has none of that — it's a one-way exit to third-party crates with no way to accidentally re-enter path manipulation.
- **One method per operation** — every operation has exactly one method. An LLM scanning the API can't pick the wrong overload because there isn't one. No aliases, no convenience wrappers, no "which one is the secure version?" Even the weakest model gets it right on the first try.
- **`#[must_use]` with instructions, not just warnings** — the compiler becomes the documentation. When an LLM generates code and forgets to handle a `strict_join()` result, it doesn't get a generic "unused Result" — it gets a message like *"always handle the Result to detect path traversal attacks"*. The LLM reads the compiler output, self-corrects, and gets it right on the next pass. No docs lookup needed.
- **Doc comments explain *why*, not just *what*** — every non-trivial function documents the reasoning behind the code, what attack a check prevents, or what invariant it enforces. An LLM working with just the source file can reason about design intent without any external context.

## 🔒 Zero Idle Dependencies

Every runtime dependency exists to close a specific security gap. Each is audited, tested against attack payloads, and covered by `cargo audit` in CI.

| Crate | Platforms | Security role |
|---|---|---|
| [`soft-canonicalize`](https://crates.io/crates/soft-canonicalize) | All | Canonicalization engine — symlink resolution, 8.3 short-name expansion, cycle detection, null-byte rejection. Maintained as part of this project. |
| [`dunce`](https://crates.io/crates/dunce) | Windows | Strips `\\?\` / `\\.\` verbatim prefixes via `std::path::Prefix` pattern matching — no lossy UTF-8 round-trip, refuses to strip when unsafe (reserved names, >260 chars, trailing dots). Zero transitive deps. |
| [`junction`](https://crates.io/crates/junction) | Windows (opt-in `junctions` feature) | NTFS junction creation and inspection for built-in junction helpers. |

On Unix the total runtime tree is **2 crates** (`soft-canonicalize` + `proc-canonicalize`). On Windows it adds `dunce` (zero transitive deps). No idle dependencies — if a crate is in the tree, it has a security job.

<details>
<summary><strong>vs manual <code>soft-canonicalize</code></strong></summary>

- `soft-canonicalize` = low-level path resolution engine (returns `PathBuf`)
- `strict-path` = high-level security API (returns `StrictPath<Marker>` with compile-time guarantees, fit for the LLM era)
