## How to Contribute

- üêõ Bug reports: [Open an issue](https://github.com/DK26/strict-path-rs/issues) with reproduction steps
- üí° Features: Discuss in an issue before implementing (see [Feature Suggestions](#feature-suggestions) below)
- üìù Docs: Fix typos, add examples, improve clarity
- üîß Code: Bug fixes and improvements welcome

## Feature Suggestions

Before suggesting features, **have your LLM agent read our [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) and [`API_REFERENCE.md`](./API_REFERENCE.md) files** and ask it:

1. Does my suggested feature align with the project's design philosophy?
2. Why might this feature not already be implemented?
3. How does this fit within existing API patterns?

**LLM Prompt:**
```
I want to suggest a feature for strict-path crate. Please read the AGENTS.md and API_REFERENCE.md files from this repository and tell me if my feature idea aligns with the design philosophy and why it might not already be implemented.
```

**Timeline expectations:**
- **Within design philosophy:** May be added in minor releases
- **Outside design philosophy:** Requires major version (potentially far future unless critical)

We encourage **all** suggestions! The distinction just helps set implementation expectations. If you want to suggest design philosophy changes, create an issue for discussion.

## Development

**Project Philosophy:**
- Type-safe security with compile-time guarantees
- Never expose raw `std::path::Path` (zero attack surface)
- Explicit method naming (`strictpath_*` vs `virtualpath_*`)
- Cross-platform CVE protection


## Testing

Just run the CI script locally:

```bash
# Linux/macOS/WSL
bash ci-local.sh

# Windows PowerShell  
.\ci-local.ps1
```

If it passes, your code is ready.
